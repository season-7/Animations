                                    The elephant’s trunk contains around 100,000 different muscles, and is used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, caressing, carrying, and grabbing objects. The sensorimotor abilities of the trunk are extensive, allowing delicate manipulations similar to a primate’s finger and thumb. African elephants have two finger-like tips on the end of their trunks, and Asian elephants have one.

                                    Elephants can control their body temperature with their ears. As they flap their ears, blood circulates through the many veins, then returns to the head and body about 9 degrees cooler. Ears are also used to signal alarm or anger when they are brought forward and fully extended.
