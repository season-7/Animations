                                        The elephant’s trunk contains around 100,000 different muscles, and is used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, caressing, carrying, and grabbing objects. The sensorimotor abilities of the trunk are extensive, allowing delicate manipulations similar to a primate’s finger and thumb. African elephants have two finger-like tips on the end of their trunks, and Asian elephants have one.

                                        Elephants can control their body temperature with their ears. As they flap their ears, blood circulates through the many veins, then returns to the head and body about 9 degrees cooler. Ears are also used to signal alarm or anger when they are brought forward and fully extended.

                                        The gnawing behavior of squirrels is explained by the continuously growth of their teeth. Like most rodents, their teeth continue to grow for their entire life. Squirrels will chew on any object that can help to wear their teeth down to a manageable size.
                                        
                                        In at least one remarkable case, this chewing resulted in problems with the NASDAQ stock market (after squirrels chewed through electric wires and caused a short circuit).

                                <p>
                                    Squirrels are also excellent sprinters, with many of them being capable of running straight up a tree at twelve miles an hour. Their speed and excellent reflexes also helps them to avoid dangerous predators, such as rattlesnakes. However, they have developed other clever ways to discourage some of their natural predators.
