                                Elephants can control their body temperature with their ears. As they flap their ears, blood circulates through the many veins, then returns to the head and body about 9 degrees cooler. Ears are also used to signal alarm or anger when they are brought forward and fully extended.

                                The elephant’s trunk contains around 100,000 different muscles, and is used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, caressing, carrying, and grabbing objects. The sensorimotor abilities of the trunk are extensive, allowing delicate manipulations similar to a primate’s finger and thumb. African elephants have two finger-like tips on the end of their trunks, and Asian elephants have one.

                                Elephant pregnancies are longer than any other mammal – nearly 22 months. A newborn elephant weighs about 200 pounds ( 91 kilograms) and stands about three feet (1 meter) tall.

                                Lioness live within the area their preceding generations controlled for life. Meanwhile, lions roam around long distances to search for other prides they can mingle and breed with. Many people, especially aspiring zoologists and animal lovers, know this fact. However, what they remain unaware of are the implications. Male lions can fend for themselves. In fact, they spend a large fraction of their lives alone hence requiring them to learn how to become an efficient hunter.

                                A few studies only support the first fact above. Nonetheless, this is an interesting discovery that could branch out more proclivities. For starters, studies have associated male hunting behavioral patterns with vegetation structure. In such cases, this was an indirect form of males caring for their young ones. Less vegetation implies less protection for the pride’s cubs. This is why African lions are forced to scout for denser vegetative lands. With denser vegetation, males have a much larger hunting ground, allowing cubs to eat more and grow stronger.

                                Another tragic but infamous fact about African lions is that a change in pride leader results in the killing of existing offspring the lioness have. What remains covert is that a male lion taking over a pride of females may force other members to run off. In fact, this is how many lioness stray from the territory she was conceived in. Although this is not necessarily a death penalty, it does drastically lower her chances of survival as lions who are not in a pride are not as strong and efficient in hunting food.

                                The gnawing behavior of squirrels is explained by the continuously growth of their teeth. Like most rodents, their teeth continue to grow for their entire life. Squirrels will chew on any object that can help to wear their teeth down to a manageable size. In at least one remarkable case, this chewing resulted in problems with the NASDAQ stock market (after squirrels chewed through electric wires and caused a short circuit).

                                Squirrels are also excellent sprinters, with many of them being capable of running straight up a tree at twelve miles an hour. Their speed and excellent reflexes also helps them to avoid dangerous predators, such as rattlesnakes. However, they have developed other clever ways to discourage some of their natural predators.

                                When motivated by food, squirrels become especially good at tackling obstacle courses. Several studies have proven that squirrels reliably find effective shortcuts, walk along tightropes and balance on unstable planks in order to locate their next meal or snack.

                                They are the natural acrobats of the animal kingdom and have the ability to pull off amazing stunts with minimal effort. They can turn their ankles 180 degrees to face any direction when climbing making the impossible a routine movement.
