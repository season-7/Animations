                                    The elephant’s trunk contains around 100,000 different muscles, and is used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, caressing, carrying, and grabbing objects. The sensorimotor abilities of the trunk are extensive, allowing delicate manipulations similar to a primate’s finger and thumb. African elephants have two finger-like tips on the end of their trunks, and Asian elephants have one.

                                    Elephants can control their body temperature with their ears. As they flap their ears, blood circulates through the many veins, then returns to the head and body about 9 degrees cooler. Ears are also used to signal alarm or anger when they are brought forward and fully extended.

                                    Lioness live within the area their preceding generations controlled for life. Male lions can fend for themselves. In fact, they spend a large fraction of their lives alone hence requiring them to learn how to become an efficient hunter.

                                    Another tragic but infamous fact about African lions is that a change in pride leader results in the killing of existing offspring the lioness have. What remains covert is that a male lion taking over a pride of females may force other members to run off. In fact, this is how many lioness stray from the territory she was conceived in.

                                    The gnawing behavior of squirrels is explained by the continuously growth of their teeth. Like most rodents, their teeth continue to grow for their entire life. Squirrels will chew on any object that can help to wear their teeth down to a manageable size. In at least one remarkable case, this chewing resulted in problems with the NASDAQ stock market (after squirrels chewed through electric wires and caused a short circuit).

                                    Squirrels are also excellent sprinters, with many of them being capable of running straight up a tree at twelve miles an hour. Their speed and excellent reflexes also helps them to avoid dangerous predators, such as rattlesnakes. However, they have developed other clever ways to discourage some of their natural predators.
